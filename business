# Business, work and success
## Start
Today is December 31, 2025, and it marks a whole year since I left my job and started working full-time at Codedevza AI. When I left my job, I had nothing. My father's business was failing and debt was crushing us. I had 3 months worth of projects at the company to support myself. Leaving my job meant leaving United Arab Emirates too as I was my company’s visa. People called me stupid for leaving my job. I’m grateful for the experiences that I had at my past workplace. I always knew that sooner or later I’d leave my job and would start a venture of my own. When Mian Khubaib, my now partner, called me and offered me to join Codedevza AI as a partner, it was a shot in the dark. I felt like I was waiting for this moment my whole life. I consulted with my father and he supported my decision. That push was all I needed. Resignations are never easy. It was very hard for me to tell my old employer that I’m going to start my own tech company. But I gathered courage and told him the truth. I was worried about my visa and then I learned the power of asking. You can just do stuff. I mean it. I simply asked my employer to not cancel my visa and he didn’t. God has always favoured me and I have always been a lucky guy. 

## Universe 
In the past, I remember discussing with my friends at the university about the concept of paying salaries. I had always worried about instability. I wondered what would happen if I am not able to pay someone’s salary. The answers were always infront of me, but I was too naive to understand the depth of words. Fast forward to now, my way of thinking has changed tremendously. I firmly believe that it is God’s responsibility to provide for people and I am simply a vessel. I don’t put food on my employees’ table, I am just the delivery guy. This belief has worked very well for me. Now, I hire without worry and I know that it will work out perfectly as God has to provide for my team and hence, our revenue increase is an indirect consequence. When I look at the successful people in my family, I see the same pattern. My maternal grandmother has many families depending on him. Every now and then, I hear about him supporting deserving families through the shadows. Is he that wealthy that he can support all this charitable work? Or is it that charitable work that is supporting his wealth? I am a firm believer of the latter. The effect is the cause. When Odin foresaw his fate learned about Loki’s rebellion, it was his future actions that caused Loki to rebel. It is similar to quantum entanglement. Mind you, I’m no expert at the subject. When two particles are in superposition, the observation of the spin direction of one particle can help us determine the spin of the other particle. And, this phenomenon happens faster than the speed of light. It makes you wonder about what’s real and how the universe operates. There are some other things that I firmly believe in. I believe that money spent on charity is returned to you manyfolds. Our small actions can have a huge impact on an outcome. Complex systems are highly dependent on the initial conditions. Everything in this world is connected. The flap of a butterfly in Mexico can cause a storm in China. The laws of physics and the wisdom our ancestors have left behind all point to this. I, sometimes, think of patterns on subatomic level and I’m baffled to see those patterns between complex beings like humans. Nature follows laws and we can use these laws to our advantage. 

## Wealth
I look at myself and then I compare myself with the successful people I know. Let’s take the example of my older employer. He is a wealthy man and he is very bad at Maths. I have seen him do simple calculations incorrectly and then infer wrong insights from it. He is not smart. Yet, he is more successful than me. He has a charismatic personality and can make people feel at ease. I believe this single quality is responsible for his riches. My maternal grandfather is a wealthy man as well and he is equally bad at Maths. I have heard tales of how he always made decisions on his instincts on a whim. He does not know me very well. We have not interacted much. He invited me and my father on a dinner and the next day, he sent a marriage proposal for his son’s daughter at my house. When I saw Barbara Corcoran speaking about how terrible she was at Maths, it all started connecting. Let’s imagine if she was good at Maths. Or if my grandfather was good at Maths. Or if Raed Hamdan, my old employer was good at Maths. Their lives would’ve been tremendously different. I can’t predict what would’ve happened but I can somewhat make a guess. They’d be involved in more accountancy-related matters playing with numbers. They may not have been this successful. Now, I was always good at Maths and I still am. As you can imagine, I actually wished I didn’t know about derivatives, integrations and trigonometry. I was very naive. The more you know, the more you realize how less you actually know. I am a learner and I can quickly adapt and update myself. Being good or bad at Maths is not an indicator of wealth. There are millions of variables at play. Maybe, someday we can accurately make a model to determine all and understand chaos or maybe even predict chaos. 
There is no one way of acquiring wealth. Everyone has to develop their own formula.
